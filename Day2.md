LEARNING THE CONCEPT OF **SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE**

Software Development Life-Cycle also known as SDLC.

SDLC is a process adopted by enterprises to design, develop and test high quality products/applications/code bases.

Average s/w process consists of:
1. PLANNING: involves requirement gathering
2. DEFINNING: involves mainly documentation, in this step we develop Software Requirement                           Specification Document, we mainly document all the requirements from STEP 1.
3. DESIGNING: this process involves the creation of LOW and HIGH LEVEL design
            - High Level Design - overall design req. eg. scalable system, which database to you etc
             - Low Level Design - consist of low level requirements such as database queries, java functions etc.
4. BUILDING: this is the development part, here the developer pushes the code to git for mutual                           collaboration
5. TESTING: involves the deployment of the git pushed code into a testing server and the code is                        tested by Quality Assurance Engineer.
6. DEPLOY: promoting the application code to production for customer use.

A DevOps engineer makes sure the building, testing and deployment phases are 
		- Efficient
		 - Quick &
		 - Automated
